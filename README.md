Project Submission
In this project, you will create a GitHub repository and your local repository. You will work on a repo for your BikeShare project, making multiple branches, making edits to files on those branches (e.g., a readme file and your Python code), and then you will commit the changes to your remote repository.

Before You Submit
Check the Rubric Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this Project Rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, be sure to take some time to revise your work until you feel it is up to expectations.

Gather Submission Materials
All you need to submit for this project is the Git Commands Documentation.

Submitting the Project
When you're ready, click on the "Submit Project" button to go to the project submission page. You can submit your file as a PDF file or a zipped file. In your GitHub repository, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at the time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each of your projects in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.

It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases, it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed. In the meantime, you should feel free to proceed with your learning journey by continuing on to the next module in the program.
